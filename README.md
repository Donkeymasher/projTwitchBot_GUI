# projTwitchBot_GUI
Basic irc bot desgined for Twitch.tv with GUI

Basically i've personally seen alot of streams/casters complaing that IRC bots are difficult to make or that someone 
is charging absurd prices to have one made, however when someone offers one for free of course they won't want it..

So here it is a basic c# IRC bot designed with twitch in mind with a wee GUI to play with before connecting
to a server then after connecting to the server switchs to a console to display the chat.

Commands not many as of yet however I will add more as it is early days yet because this so far is the result of less than
a days work.
