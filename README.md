# projTwitchBot_GUI
Basic irc bot desgined for Twitch.tv with GUI

Basically i've personally seen alot of streamers/casters complaing that IRC bots are difficult to make or that someone 
is charging absurd prices to have one made, however when someone offers one for free of course they won't want it..

So here it is a basic c# IRC bot designed with twitch in mind with a wee GUI to play with before connecting
to a server then after connecting to the server switchs to a console to display the chat.

This current build has the ground work for a dynamic command system to be put in place which I plan to implement in the coming days depending how much free time I have. 

Currently this is free and it will remain free however I need testers to put it through it's paces
